# next.js app starter template

this is a template repo for starting a next.js app fast and efficiently.

for the app it uses:

1. ðŸš€ [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (duh)
2. ðŸ’… [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

for development it uses:

1. ðŸ‘• [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. âœ¨ [hygen](https://www.hygen.io/)

## how to use

use github's "use this template" feature.

i recommend deploying to vercel, initially. you should decide based on your case! :)

## why

i needed to stop repeating myself everytime i wanted to bootstrap a new project. this seems like a good base for every type of project. i tried not to be intrusive with the stack chosen.

you can start with tw and remove it later if you don't like it (replace it for something like [stiches](https://stitches.dev/))
